# AI-BikeSharing

## Abstract
As larger cities look to expand infrastructure such as traffic, bike sharing has become more a common alternative to driving. Using a dataset of rental bikes daily usage through the Capital bikeshare system, we are able to create a regression model based on daily characteristics such as weather, day and month of the year, and how it correlates to the number of rentals for a given day. Using several regression models with the help of the pycaret library, we use AdaBoost Regressor, Light Gradient Boosting Machine, and Decision tree to help tune our models. From our observation based on the model we are able to determine that of all characteristics , the hour of the day plays the most important part of when a bike it most likely to be rented.
